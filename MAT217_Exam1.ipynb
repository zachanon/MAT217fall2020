The first player, Louise, adds to S different random numbers from the generator until S > 1 and records her last random number 'x'. The second player, Julie, continues adding to S different random numbers from the generator until S > 2 and records her last random number 'y'. The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes, i.e. if y > x the second player wins.\n",
